        "Louis Armstrong was one of the early pioneers of Jazz music, with a career that spanned five decades. Born in New Orleans in 1901, he grew up in poverty, though he worked for and received support from the Karnoffskys, a Jewish Lithuanian family who helped him to buy his first Cornet. At the age of seventeen, Louis began playing trumpet for Kid Ory's band on riverboats in the Mississippi.",
        "In 1922 he moved to Chicago to join his friend King Oliver's band, where he gained a reputation for his extended and creative trumpet solos. Although race relations were poor in the Northern city, good factory jobs meant that Afro-American workers had money left over to spend on entertainment and Armstrong became a full time musician. During this time, Armstrong's second wife (and pianist), Lil Hardin, encouraged him to broaden his musical repertoire and push for more prominent gigs. In 1924 Armstrong moved to New York for a year to join Fletcher Henderson's orchestra, the top Afro-American band of that era. Afterwards he returned to Chicago where he recorded the iconic Hot Five and Hot Seven sessions. He recorded today's featured song 'Weather Bird' with pianist Earl Hines in between these two sessions.",
        "In the following decade he travelled around the US, developing his singing voice and becoming 'the world's greatest trumpet player'. When Big Band gigs became scarce in the late forties, he formed the very famous 'All Stars' band with many famous ex-band leaders of the era. In 1957 he made national news by criticising President Eisenhower over his inaction during the conflict of school desegregation in Little Rock, Arkansas. In 1964 he recorded his biggest selling record 'Hello, Dolly!', beating out the Beatles and becoming the oldest person to reach number 1 in the Hot 100 chart.  Louis continued to tour for the rest of his life, travelling all over the US, Europe, Africa, Asia and the Soviet Block, earning him the nickname 'Ambassador Satch'."
