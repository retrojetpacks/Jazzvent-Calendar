        "Louis Armstrong was one of the early pioneers of Jazz music, with a career that spanned five decades. Born in New Orleans in 1901, he grew up in poverty, though he worked for and received support from the Karnoffskys, a Jewish Lithuanian family who helped him to buy his first Cornet. At the age of seventeen, Louis began playing trumpet for Kid Ory's band on riverboats in the Mississippi.",
        "In 1922 he moved to Chicago to join his friend King Oliver's band, where he gained a reputation for his extended and creative trumpet solos. Although race relations were poor in the Northern city, good factory jobs meant that Afro-American workers had money left over to spend on entertainment and Armstrong became a full time musician. During this time, Armstrong's second wife (and pianist), Lil Hardin, encouraged him to broaden his musical repertoire and push for more prominent gigs. In 1924 Armstrong moved to New York for a year to join Fletcher Henderson's orchestra, the top Afro-American band of that era. Afterwards he returned to Chicago where he recorded the iconic Hot Five and Hot Seven sessions. He recorded today's featured song 'Weather Bird' with pianist Earl Hines in between these two sessions.",
        "In the following decade he travelled around the US, developing his singing voice and becoming 'the world's greatest trumpet player'. When Big Band gigs became scarce in the late forties, he formed the very famous 'All Stars' band with many famous ex-band leaders of the era. In 1957 he made national news by criticising President Eisenhower over his inaction during the conflict of school desegregation in Little Rock, Arkansas. In 1964 he recorded his biggest selling record 'Hello, Dolly!', beating out the Beatles and becoming the oldest person to reach number 1 in the Hot 100 chart.  Louis continued to tour for the rest of his life, travelling all over the US, Europe, Africa, Asia and the Soviet Block, earning him the nickname 'Ambassador Satch'."

        "Alberta Hunter was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 1st 1895. She ran away from abuse when she was only 11, heading to Chicago where she took a job in a boardinghouse. By dressing up to look older and lying about her age, she managed to sneak into clubs. Despite having no one to teach her how to read music she asked for a chance as a singer and by 1915 she was singing at the Panama Café and at the Chicago Dreamland Ballroom. In 1921 she moved to New York City, where she was based for most of the rest of her life.",
        "Hunter’s original song 'Downhearted Blues' brought her recognition in 1923 when it was recorded by Bessie Smith. Alberta kept singing in New York city, collaborating with several jazz and blues musicians, including Fats Waller with whom she recorded their famous version of Beal Street Blues in 1927. Between 1927 and 1938 she travelled between the USA and Europe performing both in nightclubs and theatre productions, often accompanied by her partner Lottie Tyler. Their relationship lasted until Ms. Tyler's death, many years later. Alberta always had to be very private about her sexuality given the societal intolerance towards homosexuality. Alberta kept touring the USA during WWII, but after the death of her mother in 1954, she decided to give up singing to begin a career as a nurse.",
        "At that time Alberta was already 59 and so decided to lie about her age again. She pretended to be only 47 in order to get into the three-year YWCA training program. She completed 20 years of service becoming an excellent practical nurse appreciated by her patients. She reached the mandatory retirement age of 70 in 1977, when she was actually 82. Five months after her retirement party, she returned to performing at the Greenwich Village. Her comeback brought even greater fame which lead to the recording of 4 albums. At age 83 she recorded her masterpiece Amtrak Blues, which includes this beautiful song 'Always'. Alberta continued performing until a few months before her death in 1984."

He had an incredibly prolific career and wrote many original songs that are now swing classics: He wrote 'T'aint what you do' in 1939 with fellow musician James 'Trummy' Young. Other songs that swing dancers may recognise include 'For Dancers Only' and 'Swingin' on Nothing'!",
        "These songs were some of the biggest hits for Jimmy Lunceford's band, which Oliver joined in 1933. His many talents helped make the band a success. In 1939 he was hired by bandleader Tommy Dorsey for a considerable salary. This was notable as he was one of very few African Americans to have a prominant role in a majority white band. He gave the Tommy Dorsey band it's share of hits as well, including an arrangement of 'On the Sunny Side of the Street' and original composition 'Opus One'.",
        "In 1946 he went freelance, mainly working for Decca records. Over the next couple of decades he would work closely with such stars as Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra. He continued to live, work & play in New York for the rest of his life."

        "Django's music may have been born in the 'old world' but is one of the strongest calls to the dance floor for me, particularly for Bal and Shag. Known as Gypsy Jazz, his whimsical music combines elegance, lightness and melancholy at the same time. He was a Romani-French Jazz guitarist and composer born in Belgium in 1910 to a family of Roma travellers and musicians. He was married twice and had two sons who, along with their own families, also became well-known musicians and are carrying his legacy on.",
        "From an early age, Django played several instruments and toured the streets of Paris as a busker, playing in the street and in small clubs, until he met violinist Stéphane Grapelli, with whom he formed the quintet 'Hot Club de France'. His life was marked by as many ups as downs, one including a fire in his caravan, from which he suffered severe burns, nearly got his leg amputated and lost the use of the little and ring finger of his left hand, at the age of 18. Far from giving up, he focused on the guitar and composed all his music to suit the limited capacity of his hand, notably while being largely illiterate. Not only did he make playing with two fingers possible without diminishing the music, he played with incredible speed and accuracy. The quintet became a huge success in Europe and regularly played with travelling American musicians such as Coleman Hawkins, Eddie South, Bill Coleman, Dizzie Gillespie and Duke Ellington.",
        "WWII put an end to the quintet, and Django, being a Gypsy, had several narrow escapes and was also forced to embrace different styles of music, jazz having been banned by the Nazis. His song Nuages (Clouds, 1940) became an unofficial anthem in Paris to signify hope for liberation. After WWII, Django rejoined with Stéphane Grapelli in the UK and went on to tour the US, playing with Duke Ellington and others in front of large, enthusiastic crowds. However, no contracts materialised out of this, and he eventually returned to Europe, where he continued to evolve as the unique musician he was. He played at numerous events and later incorporated other music styles such as bebop and even tried electric guitar, but he also increasingly gave in to mood swings, wandered off to spend time with his family and developed a reputation for being unreliable. He eventually withdrew to a village 75km south of Paris, Samois-sur-Seine (which is now famous for its jazz festival held annually in his honour). In 1953, he died suddenly from a stroke at the age of only 43 while returning from a gig in a Paris club. He produced 60 records in his time and wrote up to around 100 songs and improvisations that have inspired countless people since."

She impressed pianist and arranger Claude Thornhill (later her husband), and on his first recordings as bandleader for the Vocalion label in June 1937 he featured her on the two tracks which open this 75-track, three-disc compilation covering her formative recording years. On Thornhill’s advice, she recorded under the name of Maxine Sullivan. Shortly thereafter, Sullivan became a featured vocalist at the Onyx Club in New York City",

Her contained but easy swinging phrasing, delivered with almost casual, relaxed ease and poise, eschewed showy embellishment.

A precursor to better-known later vocalists such as Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan, Maxine Sullivan is considered one of the best jazz vocalists of the 1930s.

        "Albany Leon 'Barney' Bigard (1906-1980) was a pioneering jazz clarinet soloist, perhaps most famous for featuring in Duke Ellington's band for fifteen years between 1927-1942.  Another son of New Orleans, he was born to a family of Creoles, a nebulous term that typically describes a broad cultural group with African, Native American, French and Spanish heritage. Louisiana Creoles had endured a loss of rights since the Louisiana Purchase transferred the region from the French to the fledgling United States in 1803, eventually leading to the notorious 1896 Plessy v Fergussen case which solidified the racist 'separate but equal' policy of racial segregation.",
        "In New Orleans, Barney studied under Lorenzo Tio Jr., a member of a family of professional Creole musicians credited with teaching classical techniques to many early jazz clarinettists including Sidney Bechet and Jimmy Noone. After playing in the parade bands of New Orleans, Bigard moved to Chicago at age 18 and played with King Oliver's band between 1925-1927.",
        "In 1927 he joined Duke Ellington's house band at the segregated 'whites-only' Cotton Club in Harlem where he became the featured clarinettist, famous for his 'woody' sound and fast vibrato technique. During this time he wrote and composed many songs with the great band leader such as 'Mood Indigo', 'Rocking in Rhythm' and 'Harlem Air Shaft', and even led the band that first recorded the famous jazz standard 'Caravan'.",
        "In 1942 he resigned from Duke's Orchestra due to exhaustion from their rigorous touring routine. It is perhaps ironic then that a few years later he began the second phase of his career, joining Louis Armstrong's All-Stars and travelling the world with them from 1947 to 1961 (with an interlude from 55-59). Today's featured song 'Drop Me Off in Harlem' is taken from the album 'The Great Summit', a 1961 joint effort in which Bigard acts as a bridge between Ellington and Armstrong. You can really hear the playful, conversational interplay of piano, trumpet and clarinet, honed by a lifetime of playing together.",

She went on to be classically trained at Hick’s School of Music and Fisk University. While encouraging with her musical training, her mother banned her from having anything to do with jazz and blues when she was a teenager. However the family relocated to Chicago, the centre of the burgeoning jazz scene, and Lil found a job at a music store where met Jelly Roll Morton and King Oliver, before starting to make a living as a jazz pianist.",
        "At a time when women, especially black women, were often relegated to singing or dancing in the chorus line, Lil Hardin had a career as a respected jazz composer, pianist and bandleader.  She performed with Sugar Johnny’s Creole Orchestra, Freddie Keppard’s Band, the New Orleans Wanderers and led her own band at the Dreamland Café. She joined ‘King’ Oliver’s band in the 1920’s and it was here she met a young Louis Armstrong.  She stood out in the band as a classically trained musician while many of the band members could not read music. Louis Armstrong is quoted as saying 'it was startling to find a valedictorian fall in line and play such good jazz'. By this time while Louis was the new kid in town, Lil was the established player in the Chicago jazz scene and she saw tremendous potential in his playing, helping to launch him as a soloist by being the driving force behind bookings. She is credited for shaping his early career and was a major contributor to many of his best known recordings, including Hot Five and Hot Seven.  Lil continued to have a rich career in music throughout their partnership and after their divorce in 1938.  She embraced the role of Musical Director for Decca Records sepia series, worked on broadway shows and made numerous vocal recordings. In the late 1960s she backed off from the music business and spent more and more time in a lakeside property bought by her and Louis in Michigan.",
        "The featured song 'My Heart', composed by Lil, was first conceived as a waltz in 3/4 time; but Louis and Lil always played it as a hot jazz piece in 4/4 time. Seven years after she died in 1971, a song composed by Lil Hardin Armstrong topped the pop charts; Ringo Starr recorded her composition 'Bad Boy' in 1978 and it was on the radio all over the world."

Nance (1913-1976) was a multi-talented trumpet, cornet, violin and piano player, as well as a singer and dancer. He led his own band in Chicago from the age of 19 to 24, before spending a few years playing with Earl Hines and Horace Henderson, and even managing his own solo show.",
        "He moved to New York where he joined Duke Ellington's band in 1940 as a late arrival, the band had been touring for nine years by that point. Nance replaced his idol, the bombastic Cootie Williams on plunger trumpet (a staple of the Ellington sound first introduced by Bubber Miley). Ten years after teaching Cootie, the trombonist 'Tricky' Sam Nanton helped Nance to develop his own distinctive plunger mute style.",
        "Nance's most famous contribution to jazz may be his muted trumpet solo on the earliest recording of today's featured song, 'Take the A Train' (starting at 0:51). This Billy Strayhorn composition became the new theme of the Ellington orchestra, replacing 'Sepia Panorama'. The A in A Train refers to the newly opened New York A subway that runs from Brooklyn to Harlem.",
        "Notably, Nance is the only violin soloist featured in Ellington's orchestra, and is responsible for the famous violin solos in 'CJam blues' and 'Mr Gentle and Mr Cool' that some of you may recognise. You may have also heard his 'highly animated vocals' from later recordings of A Train.",
        "Cootie returned to Ellington's band in 1962 and Ray switched to cornet to make way for him. Things came to a head a year later in the 1963 Middle East tour when the two had a confrontation, leading Cootie to slap Nance. In part due to this mistreatment from his old idol, Nance requested to leave the tour early, afterwards only ever making guest appearances with the Duke. Cootie would continue to play Nance's 'A' Train solo 'note for note' after his departure."

After the death of his mother and under the encouragement of his brother, 11-year old Roy began to practice the trumpet. Eldridge was not inspired by trumpeters, but by saxophonists instead, playing along to recordings of Coleman Hawkins and Benny Carter.",
        "He moved to NYC in 1930, starting to play with various Harlem swing dance bands. Before beginning his career as a soloist (in 1943), Eldridge played for Count Basie who defined him as 'the greatest trumpet I'd ever heard in my life.', and also with Fletcher Henderson, Gene Krupa, Artie Shaw, Benny Goodman and Coleman Hawkins.",
        "As a black soloist in several white bands, Eldridge suffered greatly from racial discrimination. 'Droves of people would ask him for his autograph at the end of the night, but later, on the bus, he wouldn't be able to get off and buy a hamburger with the guys in the band.' commented Artie Shaw.",
        "Despite his success as a swing trumpeter, it seems like R.E. much more preferred to jam some bebop in small groups after the main gig, away from dancers. He was extremely competitive, and willing to play against anyone.",
        "Today's featured song is named for Roy's nickname. I love that during the riff, as a dancer you have a lot of opportuinites to respond to the music, rather than just dancing to the melody.

Bolden, a cornetist, played in numerous bands covering popular dance-music styles of the time including waltz and ragtime, but when it came to the blues, Bolden produced something new.",
        "While there are no known recordings of Buddy Bolden, his style is described as powerful, improvisational, and he added a ‘ragged’ rhythmic feel to his playing, which earned him the nickname ‘The Cornet King of New Orleans’. Combining the guttural moans of the blues with the spirit of the Black Baptist church, he originated a unique and eminently danceable new style to the music.",
        "Bolden, appealing to a new generation of dancers, including many considered ‘hustlers, pimps and prostitutes’ from the Black Storyville neighbourhood, gained a large number of followers across New Orleans. He would utilise the remarkable power he could produce from his cornet to blast out a signature call from Johnson Park to let those in Lincoln Park know that his band were about to kick off an open-air dance. His style, also considered raunchier than many others of the time, was well suited to the bars and underbelly of New Orleans too. He played in bars and dance halls, like the Union Sons Hall on Perdido Street, often performing for dancers until 5 am, drinking heavily himself, and enjoying both alcohol and women.",
        "Toward his late 20s, his temperament became increasingly erratic. He often complained of headaches, and a paranoia that other musicians would steal his style and music took hold. In 1906, while joining in a marching street band, he suddenly stopped, and is said to have screamed, then walked off without another word. In 1907, as the result of his increasingly erratic behaviour and distressed mental state, his mother had him committed to the Louisiana State asylum. It is believed now that he suffered a breakdown as the result of schizophrenic disorder, but mental health care then was not what it is now, and a diagnosis of his condition cannot be confirmed. He remained in the asylum until his death in 1931.",

Peterson grew up in the Black neighbourhood of Little Burgundy in Montreal, where he encountered jazz culture. He directed his attention to the piano, with the help of his dad and his sister Daisy, who taught him classical piano.",

In his style, Peterson maintained both the traditional rag time, swing piano and boogie-woogie, but also incorporated unpredictable motifs of modern bebop in his improvised solos. Oscar released over 200 recordings and won eight Grammy Awards. Since June 2010, you can find a statue remembering him at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa.",

        "Billy Strayhorn (1915-1967) was an American jazz composer, pianist, lyricist and arranger. He is best remembered for his long-term collaboration with bandleader and composer Duke Ellington.",
        "Billy’s love of the piano was evident from an early age; he played his grandmother’s piano from the moment he was tall enough to reach the keys. While still at school, Strayhorn self-funded his early musical education; he bought himself a piano and lessons using savings from a part time job. In his final year in high school, Billy wrote a sophisticated Cole Porter-style musical review, which he called Fantastic Rhythm. He was also the only black musician in a 25-player orchestra.",
        "Hoping to foster his classical career he attended The Pittsburgh Musical Institute for two months in 1936 to study piano and music theory. He left after the sudden death of his teacher, Charles Boyd. Strayhorn said that there was no one else that could teach him. The classical world was almost entirely white at the time and the racism Billy faced seemingly halted his dreams to become a classical composer. It was not until the 1960's that the first afro-american concert pianist, André Watts, was able to rise to prominence. Instead, Billy turned to jazz; his early influences include Art Tatum, Earl Hines and Teddy Wilson.",
        "Billy met Duke Ellington backstage at a concert in 1938. The 23 year old played Sophisticated Lady back to Duke the way he had played it in the concert and then proceeded to show him how he would play it. Duke was sufficiently impressed with Strayhorn to hire him on the spot, so began a 30 year working bond between Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn.",
        "Strayhorn's arrangements had a tremendous impact on the Ellington band. The collaboration between Billy Strayhorn and Duke Ellington is widely known to have brought us such classics as 'Take The 'A' Train', 'Chelsea Bridge' and 'Isfahan'.",
        "Despite having to face racism and homophobia, Strayhorn openly identified as gay in the 1940s. A man of strong beliefs, Strayhorn became a committed civil rights advocate and was a close friend of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.",
        "Ellington said of Strayhorn, 'He was not, as he was often referred to by many, my alter ego. Billy Strayhorn was my right arm, my left arm, all the eyes in the back of my head, my brain-waves in his head, and his in mine.'"

        "William 'Count' Basie truly was one of the giants of the swing era. Pianist, composer and bandleader, his music is iconic in the swing dance world and there's so much that could be said about his influence on jazz. We'll try and keep this brief... Whether it's the fast paced Jumping At The Woodside (often used for the Mama Stew routine!) or the laid back classic Shiny Stockings (Frankie Manning's favourite tune) Basie's extensive and varied repertoire shows the evolution of swing music throughout the mid 20th century.",
        "Like most of his contemporaries, he came from a musical family and was playing the piano from a young age, taught initially by his mother. He moved to Harlem in NYC in the early 1920s and so started his musical career just as jazz was in its infancy. In 1929 he joined Bennie Moten's orchestra in Kansas City and in his role as composer/arranger and pianist he helped to develop what became known as the Kansas City sound. Moten died in 1935 and Basie formed his own band with many of Moten's former members. They rose to fame playing in clubs and on local radio in Kansas City, before moving to Chicago and then on to NYC where they secured a residency at the Woodside Hotel (hence 'Jumping At The...'). They also played to dancers at the Roseland Ballroom and the most hallowed of lindy hop venues, the Savoy Ballroom. It was here that they went head to head with Chick Webb's orchestra in one of the famous 'Battle of the Bands'. The Count Basie Orchestra were crowned winners that night.",
        "Basie's music is often divided into 'Old Testament' and 'New Testament', the former being more rooted in the classic sound of the swing era, while the latter took more influences from bebop and other jazz styles. After WW2, many big bands broke up as the public's preference moved to more of a small combo sound and the development of better electric amplification made the need for large bands unnecessary. For a few years after the war, Basie toured and recorded with a variety of small combos but he was persuaded by a friend to reform a 16 piece big band - the New Testament band - in 1952. Try listening to different Basie tunes and see if you can feel the difference between the two styles."

        "Valaida Snow (1904-1956) was a virtuoso American jazz musician and entertainer who became an internationally celebrated talent. Snow was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Her mother, Etta, was a Howard University-educated music teacher and her father, John, was a minister who was also the leader of the [CW- offensive and racist term for small black children] Pickaninny Troubadours, a group mainly consisting of child performers. She was raised on the road in a show-business family, where starting from the age of 5, she began performing with her father's group. By the time she was 15, she had learned to play no less than the cello, bass, banjo, violin, mandolin, harp, accordion, clarinet, trumpet, and saxophone (easy, right...?). Of course, she also sang and danced, and loved telling tall tales to keep her audience entertained - a true multi-talent.",
        "However, she became most famous for playing the trumpet - in fact, she was known as 'Little Louis', as her talent was compared to that of Louis Armstrong, whose style of playing she had in parts adopted, and was later given the nickname 'Queen of the Trumpet'.",
        "Her most successful period was in the 1930s when she became the toast of London and Paris, dancing and playing the trumpet, living a life in luxury, with an open-top European style car, a footman, a driver and even a pet monkey, apparently all dressed the same. Around this time, she recorded her hit song 'High Hat, Trumpet, and Rhythm'. She performed in 'Rhapsody in Black' in New York, a show run by Ethel Waters, with whom she ended up having a years-long rivalry. In the mid-1930s, she also made films with her husband, Ananias Berry, of the Berry Brothers dancing troupe. Ananias was nine years younger than Valaida, and their marriage was not received well and later broke apart due to investigations and pressure from Ananias’ family.",
        "After playing the Apollo Theatre in New York City, she revisited Europe, Russia and the Far East for more shows and films, hanging out with her friend Josephine Baker and the international elite and royalty. When WWII broke out, however, her luck gradually ran out when Nazi soldiers took over Denmark where she was touring, and she was put in a prisoner-of-war jail on the grounds of theft and illegal drugs for 18 months. In May 1942, she was released on a prisoner exchange. It was rumoured that her friendship with a Belgian police official helped her to board a ship carrying foreign diplomats.",
        "When she got back to the States, she had lost almost half her body weight and was in bad shape. According to jazz historian Scott Yanow, 'she never emotionally recovered from the experience'. But she settled in, married an old friend and promoter, Earl Edwards, and gradually grappled back to modest stardom, still being remembered for her talent and improvisation skills. Sadly, aged only 51, Valaida Snow died of a brain haemorrhage on May 30, 1956, in New York City, backstage during a performance at the Palace Theatre.",
        "I chose the song “Patience and Fortitude” as it is apt for our times – be patient and strong, people… and it showcases her singing and trumpeting talent."

        "Born James Fletcher Hamilton Henderson in Cuthbert, Georgia, in 1897.  His parents were both teachers and his mother taught him and his brother Horace to play piano. He begain formal lessons at the age of 6 and his father is rumoured to have locked him in his room to practice.  Henderson had excellent pitch and by his teenage years a keen ability to read music. However, at age 18 he decided to pursue maths and science rather than music. At age 18 he moved to Atlanta to study Chemistry and Mathematics.  It was here he changed his name to Fletcher.  After graduation he moved to New York City with the intention of attending Columbia University for a master’s.  Things took a different turn when the pianist he shared an apartment with fell ill and Henderson took his place for a performance. He was soon given the job full time. Henderson now found that music would be more profitable than chemistry and left his job as a lab chemist to begin a life in music.",
        "He became musical director of Black Swan Records which lasted from 1921 – 1923, where he primarily played piano accompaniment for blues singers.  His band at this point was only a pick-up unit for recordings, not a regular working band. However the musicians that Henderson took on, usually presented as ‘Fletcher Henderson and his Orchestra’, were starting to grow in importance. A man who played several reed instruments, Don Redman, became a regular member of Henderson’s recording groups in the early twenties and a principal arranger.",
        "In January 1924 the recording band became the house band at the Club Alabam.  In July 1924 the band began to play for the Roseland Ballroom – it was one of the first African American bands to play at Roseland. Later that same year in October the Henderson band made history when they emerged with Louis Armstrong now in the orchestra.  The band soon became known as the best African – American band in New York.",
        "By late 1924 using arrangements created by Don Redman, the band was featuring more solo work. In addition to adding hot solos to arrangements, Redman rearranged Armstrong's repertoire developed with the King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, such as turning 'Dippermouth Blues' into 'Sugar Foot Stomp'. Armstrong played in the band for only a year because he could not grow accustomed to the arrangements and to the 'pretension' of the other band members. Despite this, his influence on the Henderson band and all jazz during this time cannot be overstated. Through his hot solos, knowledge of jazz repertoire, and introduction of clarinetist Buster Bailey to the band, Armstrong turned Henderson's Orchestra into a jazz band. Henderson and Redman continued producing great arrangements after Louis’s departure and the Henderson Orchestra went on to be recognised as the finest black orchestra in New York until near the decade’s end."

        "Another early jazz protegée of the musical stewing pot that was New Orleans, Sidney Bechet was said to be the only musician who, until 1925, could stand up next to Louis Armstrong and keep up. Born in 1897, he largely taught himself to play on instruments kept around his home, a  musical household through his father Leonard Victor Bechet, a part-time trombonist and bandleader, and his older brother Leonard, also a trombonist. Demonstrating a masterful grasp of the clarinet, by the age of eight he’d sat in with the second cornet king of New Olreans, Freddie Keppard’s band. By the age of 15 he’d worked with a range of prominent bands including Buddie Petit’s Young Olympians in 1909, John Robichaux in 1911-1912 and Jo ‘King’ Oliver in The Big Olympic Band.",
        "In his late teenage years he set out from New Orleans to travel the states, reaching as far north as Chicago, where he further performed with Freddie Keppard and King Oliver. In 1919, having reached New York, he set out on a groundbreaking tour of Europe with the Southern Syncopated Orchestra of Will Marion Cook, a student of the classical composer Antonín Dvorák.",
        "As a clarinetist his style is described by a wide, but controlled vibrato, large, warm tones, and an improvisational mastery akin to Louis Armstrong. The fervour and force of Bechet’s playing seems to have been a reflection of his attitude towards others too. Often quarrelsome, in 1919 following a pay dispute he promptly left Will Marion Cook’s Orchestra, and spent a couple of years working in London and France, putting down his first recordings (of 'High Society' and 'Tiger Rag'), and starting his own group. It was in London that he began the transition from the clarinet to soprano saxophone.",
        "In 1922 he was deported back to the US following two weeks in jail on a charge of assaulting a prostitute in London. Back in the States, he continued to record and tour, working with Duke Ellington, an admirer of his, for several months. He performed with others like Willie ‘The Lion’ Smith and Clarence Williams, and toured in a production featuring Bessie Smith. Towards the end of 1925 he returned to Europe, joining La Revue Negre in France, the show that propelled Josephine Baker to eminence. After Baker left the show, Bechet continued to tour Europe and beyond with the remnants of the cast of La Revue Negre. They travelled as far as Istanbul, Cairo, and Russia, taking Jazz to where it had never been heard before, and to such remote places that passersby were said to have licked their fingers and rubbed them on Bechet’s cheek to see if the colour would come off.",
        "In 1928 he landed himself in jail once more, this time in France. The story goes that a pianist he was performing with at the time attempted to correct him on a chord played. Given that Bechet 'never plays the wrong chord', he took offence, pulling out a gun and challenging the pianist to a pistol duet the following afternoon, mid-Parisian rush hour no less. The pianist showed, but Bechet’s shot went wide, striking another musician in the leg, and slightly injuring two women bystanders. He was sentenced to 15 months in prison, but was released after 11 on the grounds he would leave France immediately. In the words of Wynton Marsalis 'but that’s just how serious he was about music… he was going to kill somebody over some chord changes'.",
        "During the 30s, Bechet continued to perform and record, but his career saw a decline throughout the middle of the decade, taking a back seat to the growing number of big swing bands taking over the jazz stage. His career was rekindled going into the 1940s, where he made many of his most famous recordings, through a revival of interest in early jazz styles."

He became a professional pianist at 15, despite the disapproval of his clergyman father for whom he had played the organ from age 10.  Initially working in cabarets and theatres, by the late 1920’s he was also an established songwriter.  In 1934 he started recording with a small band, uniquely mixing skilful jazz and slapstick, for which he became well known.  He was the first jazz musician to master the organ and he appeared in several films, including Stormy Weather.",

The hotel was owned by Al Capone and as Waller was ordered inside the building he found a party taking place.  He was pushed towards the piano with a gun in his back and told to play. A terrified Waller was relieved to find he was the surprise guest at Capone’s birthday party!"

        "Paul Gonsalvez (1920-1974) is another of the later big band jazz generation, a tenor saxophonist who played in Duke Ellington's band. He is most famous for the mind-bending 27 chorus sax solo in today's featured song 'Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue' (starting at 4:05, I won't blame you for skipping to it!).",
        "Gonsalvez grew up in Massachusetts and Rhode Island in a family of immigrants from Cape Verde, still a Portugese colony at that time. As a child his father taught him how to play the guitar, and the family started a folk band playing Cape Verdean and crioulo songs. As a teenager Paul and his brother went to see the Jimmy Lunceford Orchestra, where Paul was immediately impressed by the saxophone playing of Willie Smith. His sister Julia recalled how he began pantomime playing a sax at home, and that eventually his father helped him to buy his first melody C tenor. After studying saxophone in the Boston Conservatory, Gonsalvez began to play with big bands in New Bedford, Massachusetts, which were dominated by musicians of Cape Verdean descent.",
        "The start of his career was interrupted by his military service in World War II, during which he served in India and Burma. Returning from the war he cemented his name playing in the Sabby Lewis band, before replacing Illinois Jacquet in Count Basie's band (47-49)  then doing a brief stint with Dizzy Gillespie (49-50). After Dizzy was forced to dissolve his band in 1950, Gonsalvez was allegedly down to his last seven dollars when he bumped into Ellington in Manhattan. He was offered a job the next day and would spend the rest of his life in the Ellington Orchestra.",
        "A shortage of big band gigs in the early fifties caused some trouble for Ellington, but the band pulled through and started to get back on track. Their big 'come back' gig was at the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival on Rhode Island, and Ellington was well aware that his star sax player had come back to his home turf, they were playing not thirty minutes away from Gonsalvez' childhood home. After midnight in the second half of their split set, the Duke asked Gonsalvez to play the interlude between 'Diminuendo' and 'Crescendo in Blue'. Urged on by his friends and family, Gonsalvez played the best solo of his life and sent the crowd wild.",
        "Gonsalvez passed just ten days before Ellington in 1974. Notably, Duke's son Mercer kept his death a secret from his father to spare him the sadness."
