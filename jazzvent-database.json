        "Louis Armstrong was one of the early pioneers of Jazz music, with a career that spanned five decades. Born in New Orleans in 1901, he grew up in poverty, though he worked for and received support from the Karnoffskys, a Jewish Lithuanian family who helped him to buy his first Cornet. At the age of seventeen, Louis began playing trumpet for Kid Ory's band on riverboats in the Mississippi.",
        "In 1922 he moved to Chicago to join his friend King Oliver's band, where he gained a reputation for his extended and creative trumpet solos. Although race relations were poor in the Northern city, good factory jobs meant that Afro-American workers had money left over to spend on entertainment and Armstrong became a full time musician. During this time, Armstrong's second wife (and pianist), Lil Hardin, encouraged him to broaden his musical repertoire and push for more prominent gigs. In 1924 Armstrong moved to New York for a year to join Fletcher Henderson's orchestra, the top Afro-American band of that era. Afterwards he returned to Chicago where he recorded the iconic Hot Five and Hot Seven sessions. He recorded today's featured song 'Weather Bird' with pianist Earl Hines in between these two sessions.",
        "In the following decade he travelled around the US, developing his singing voice and becoming 'the world's greatest trumpet player'. When Big Band gigs became scarce in the late forties, he formed the very famous 'All Stars' band with many famous ex-band leaders of the era. In 1957 he made national news by criticising President Eisenhower over his inaction during the conflict of school desegregation in Little Rock, Arkansas. In 1964 he recorded his biggest selling record 'Hello, Dolly!', beating out the Beatles and becoming the oldest person to reach number 1 in the Hot 100 chart.  Louis continued to tour for the rest of his life, travelling all over the US, Europe, Africa, Asia and the Soviet Block, earning him the nickname 'Ambassador Satch'."

        "Alberta Hunter was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 1st 1895. She ran away from abuse when she was only 11, heading to Chicago where she took a job in a boardinghouse. By dressing up to look older and lying about her age, she managed to sneak into clubs. Despite having no one to teach her how to read music she asked for a chance as a singer and by 1915 she was singing at the Panama Café and at the Chicago Dreamland Ballroom. In 1921 she moved to New York City, where she was based for most of the rest of her life.",
        "Hunter’s original song 'Downhearted Blues' brought her recognition in 1923 when it was recorded by Bessie Smith. Alberta kept singing in New York city, collaborating with several jazz and blues musicians, including Fats Waller with whom she recorded their famous version of Beal Street Blues in 1927. Between 1927 and 1938 she travelled between the USA and Europe performing both in nightclubs and theatre productions, often accompanied by her partner Lottie Tyler. Their relationship lasted until Ms. Tyler's death, many years later. Alberta always had to be very private about her sexuality given the societal intolerance towards homosexuality. Alberta kept touring the USA during WWII, but after the death of her mother in 1954, she decided to give up singing to begin a career as a nurse.",
        "At that time Alberta was already 59 and so decided to lie about her age again. She pretended to be only 47 in order to get into the three-year YWCA training program. She completed 20 years of service becoming an excellent practical nurse appreciated by her patients. She reached the mandatory retirement age of 70 in 1977, when she was actually 82. Five months after her retirement party, she returned to performing at the Greenwich Village. Her comeback brought even greater fame which lead to the recording of 4 albums. At age 83 she recorded her masterpiece Amtrak Blues, which includes this beautiful song 'Always'. Alberta continued performing until a few months before her death in 1984."

He had an incredibly prolific career and wrote many original songs that are now swing classics: He wrote 'T'aint what you do' in 1939 with fellow musician James 'Trummy' Young. Other songs that swing dancers may recognise include 'For Dancers Only' and 'Swingin' on Nothing'!",
        "These songs were some of the biggest hits for Jimmy Lunceford's band, which Oliver joined in 1933. His many talents helped make the band a success. In 1939 he was hired by bandleader Tommy Dorsey for a considerable salary. This was notable as he was one of very few African Americans to have a prominant role in a majority white band. He gave the Tommy Dorsey band it's share of hits as well, including an arrangement of 'On the Sunny Side of the Street' and original composition 'Opus One'.",
        "In 1946 he went freelance, mainly working for Decca records. Over the next couple of decades he would work closely with such stars as Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra. He continued to live, work & play in New York for the rest of his life."

        "Django's music may have been born in the 'old world' but is one of the strongest calls to the dance floor for me, particularly for Bal and Shag. Known as Gypsy Jazz, his whimsical music combines elegance, lightness and melancholy at the same time. He was a Romani-French Jazz guitarist and composer born in Belgium in 1910 to a family of Roma travellers and musicians. He was married twice and had two sons who, along with their own families, also became well-known musicians and are carrying his legacy on.",
        "From an early age, Django played several instruments and toured the streets of Paris as a busker, playing in the street and in small clubs, until he met violinist Stéphane Grapelli, with whom he formed the quintet 'Hot Club de France'. His life was marked by as many ups as downs, one including a fire in his caravan, from which he suffered severe burns, nearly got his leg amputated and lost the use of the little and ring finger of his left hand, at the age of 18. Far from giving up, he focused on the guitar and composed all his music to suit the limited capacity of his hand, notably while being largely illiterate. Not only did he make playing with two fingers possible without diminishing the music, he played with incredible speed and accuracy. The quintet became a huge success in Europe and regularly played with travelling American musicians such as Coleman Hawkins, Eddie South, Bill Coleman, Dizzie Gillespie and Duke Ellington.",
        "WWII put an end to the quintet, and Django, being a Gypsy, had several narrow escapes and was also forced to embrace different styles of music, jazz having been banned by the Nazis. His song Nuages (Clouds, 1940) became an unofficial anthem in Paris to signify hope for liberation. After WWII, Django rejoined with Stéphane Grapelli in the UK and went on to tour the US, playing with Duke Ellington and others in front of large, enthusiastic crowds. However, no contracts materialised out of this, and he eventually returned to Europe, where he continued to evolve as the unique musician he was. He played at numerous events and later incorporated other music styles such as bebop and even tried electric guitar, but he also increasingly gave in to mood swings, wandered off to spend time with his family and developed a reputation for being unreliable. He eventually withdrew to a village 75km south of Paris, Samois-sur-Seine (which is now famous for its jazz festival held annually in his honour). In 1953, he died suddenly from a stroke at the age of only 43 while returning from a gig in a Paris club. He produced 60 records in his time and wrote up to around 100 songs and improvisations that have inspired countless people since."

On Thornhill’s advice, she recorded under the name of Maxine Sullivan. Shortly thereafter, Sullivan became a featured vocalist at the Onyx Club in New York City",

Her contained but easy swinging phrasing, delivered with almost casual, relaxed ease and poise, eschewed showy embellishment.

A precursor to better-known later vocalists such as Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan, Maxine Sullivan is considered one of the best jazz vocalists of the 1930s.

        "Albany Leon 'Barney' Bigard (1906-1980) was a pioneering jazz clarinet soloist, perhaps most famous for featuring in Duke Ellington's band for fifteen years between 1927-1942.  Another son of New Orleans, he was born to a family of Creoles, a nebulous term that typically describes a broad cultural group with African, Native American, French and Spanish heritage. Louisiana Creoles had endured a loss of rights since the Louisiana Purchase transferred the region from the French to the fledgling United States in 1803, eventually leading to the notorious 1896 Plessy v Fergussen case which solidified the racist 'separate but equal' policy of racial segregation.",
        "In New Orleans, Barney studied under Lorenzo Tio Jr., a member of a family of professional Creole musicians credited with teaching classical techniques to many early jazz clarinettists including Sidney Bechet and Jimmy Noone. After playing in the parade bands of New Orleans, Bigard moved to Chicago at age 18 and played with King Oliver's band between 1925-1927.",
        "In 1927 he joined Duke Ellington's house band at the segregated 'whites-only' Cotton Club in Harlem where he became the featured clarinettist, famous for his 'woody' sound and fast vibrato technique. During this time he wrote and composed many songs with the great band leader such as 'Mood Indigo', 'Rocking in Rhythm' and 'Harlem Air Shaft', and even led the band that first recorded the famous jazz standard 'Caravan'.",
        "In 1942 he resigned from Duke's Orchestra due to exhaustion from their rigorous touring routine. It is perhaps ironic then that a few years later he began the second phase of his career, joining Louis Armstrong's All-Stars and travelling the world with them from 1947 to 1961 (with an interlude from 55-59). Today's featured song 'Drop Me Off in Harlem' is taken from the album 'The Great Summit', a 1961 joint effort in which Bigard acts as a bridge between Ellington and Armstrong. You can really hear the playful, conversational interplay of piano, trumpet and clarinet, honed by a lifetime of playing together.",

She went on to be classically trained at Hick’s School of Music and Fisk University. While encouraging with her musical training, her mother banned her from having anything to do with jazz and blues when she was a teenager. However the family relocated to Chicago, the centre of the burgeoning jazz scene, and Lil found a job at a music store where met Jelly Roll Morton and King Oliver, before starting to make a living as a jazz pianist.",
        "At a time when women, especially black women, were often relegated to singing or dancing in the chorus line, Lil Hardin had a career as a respected jazz composer, pianist and bandleader.  She performed with Sugar Johnny’s Creole Orchestra, Freddie Keppard’s Band, the New Orleans Wanderers and led her own band at the Dreamland Café. She joined ‘King’ Oliver’s band in the 1920’s and it was here she met a young Louis Armstrong.  She stood out in the band as a classically trained musician while many of the band members could not read music. Louis Armstrong is quoted as saying 'it was startling to find a valedictorian fall in line and play such good jazz'. By this time while Louis was the new kid in town, Lil was the established player in the Chicago jazz scene and she saw tremendous potential in his playing, helping to launch him as a soloist by being the driving force behind bookings. She is credited for shaping his early career and was a major contributor to many of his best known recordings, including Hot Five and Hot Seven.  Lil continued to have a rich career in music throughout their partnership and after their divorce in 1938.  She embraced the role of Musical Director for Decca Records sepia series, worked on broadway shows and made numerous vocal recordings. In the late 1960s she backed off from the music business and spent more and more time in a lakeside property bought by her and Louis in Michigan.",
        "The featured song 'My Heart', composed by Lil, was first conceived as a waltz in 3/4 time; but Louis and Lil always played it as a hot jazz piece in 4/4 time. Seven years after she died in 1971, a song composed by Lil Hardin Armstrong topped the pop charts; Ringo Starr recorded her composition 'Bad Boy' in 1978 and it was on the radio all over the world."

Nance (1913-1976) was a multi-talented trumpet, cornet, violin and piano player, as well as a singer and dancer. He led his own band in Chicago from the age of 19 to 24, before spending a few years playing with Earl Hines and Horace Henderson, and even managing his own solo show.",
        "He moved to New York where he joined Duke Ellington's band in 1940 as a late arrival, the band had been touring for nine years by that point. Nance replaced his idol, the bombastic Cootie Williams on plunger trumpet (a staple of the Ellington sound first introduced by Bubber Miley). Ten years after teaching Cootie, the trombonist 'Tricky' Sam Nanton helped Nance to develop his own distinctive plunger mute style.",
        "Nance's most famous contribution to jazz may be his muted trumpet solo on the earliest recording of today's featured song, 'Take the A Train' (starting at 0:51). This Billy Strayhorn composition became the new theme of the Ellington orchestra, replacing 'Sepia Panorama'. The A in A Train refers to the newly opened New York A subway that runs from Brooklyn to Harlem.",
        "Notably, Nance is the only violin soloist featured in Ellington's orchestra, and is responsible for the famous violin solos in 'CJam blues' and 'Mr Gentle and Mr Cool' that some of you may recognise. You may have also heard his 'highly animated vocals' from later recordings of A Train.",
        "Cootie returned to Ellington's band in 1962 and Ray switched to cornet to make way for him. Things came to a head a year later in the 1963 Middle East tour when the two had a confrontation, leading Cootie to slap Nance. In part due to this mistreatment from his old idol, Nance requested to leave the tour early, afterwards only ever making guest appearances with the Duke. Cootie would continue to play Nance's 'A' Train solo 'note for note' after his departure."

After the death of his mother and under the encouragement of his brother, 11-year old Roy began to practice the trumpet. Eldridge was not inspired by trumpeters, but by saxophonists instead, playing along to recordings of Coleman Hawkins and Benny Carter.",
        "He moved to NYC in 1930, starting to play with various Harlem swing dance bands. Before beginning his career as a soloist (in 1943), Eldridge played for Count Basie who defined him as 'the greatest trumpet I'd ever heard in my life.', and also with Fletcher Henderson, Gene Krupa, Artie Shaw, Benny Goodman and Coleman Hawkins.",
        "As a black soloist in several white bands, Eldridge suffered greatly from racial discrimination. 'Droves of people would ask him for his autograph at the end of the night, but later, on the bus, he wouldn't be able to get off and buy a hamburger with the guys in the band.' commented Artie Shaw.",
        "Despite his success as a swing trumpeter, it seems like R.E. much more preferred to jam some bebop in small groups after the main gig, away from dancers. He was extremely competitive, and willing to play against anyone.",
        "Today's featured song is named for Roy's nickname. I love that during the riff, as a dancer you have a lot of opportuinites to respond to the music, rather than just dancing to the melody. You can hear so many of the members of the band playing off each other. The sound is so crisp and you can how each instrument is separate, yet playing harmoniously with each other.

Bolden, a cornetist, played in numerous bands covering popular dance-music styles of the time including waltz and ragtime, but when it came to the blues, Bolden produced something new.",
        "While there are no known recordings of Buddy Bolden, his style is described as powerful, improvisational, and he added a ‘ragged’ rhythmic feel to his playing, which earned him the nickname ‘The Cornet King of New Orleans’. Combining the guttural moans of the blues with the spirit of the Black Baptist church, he originated a unique and eminently danceable new style to the music.",
        "Bolden, appealing to a new generation of dancers, including many considered ‘hustlers, pimps and prostitutes’ from the Black Storyville neighbourhood, gained a large number of followers across New Orleans. He would utilise the remarkable power he could produce from his cornet to blast out a signature call from Johnson Park to let those in Lincoln Park know that his band were about to kick off an open-air dance. His style, also considered raunchier than many others of the time, was well suited to the bars and underbelly of New Orleans too. He played in bars and dance halls, like the Union Sons Hall on Perdido Street, often performing for dancers until 5 am, drinking heavily himself, and enjoying both alcohol and women.",
        "Toward his late 20s, his temperament became increasingly erratic. He often complained of headaches, and a paranoia that other musicians would steal his style and music took hold. In 1906, while joining in a marching street band, he suddenly stopped, and is said to have screamed, then walked off without another word. In 1907, as the result of his increasingly erratic behaviour and distressed mental state, his mother had him committed to the Louisiana State asylum. It is believed now that he suffered a breakdown as the result of schizophrenic disorder, but mental health care then was not what it is now, and a diagnosis of his condition cannot be confirmed. He remained in the asylum until his death in 1931.",
        "Some consider him to be the creator of Jazz, but even if this claim is disputed, he was certainly the first King of Jazz. Only one photograph of Buddy Bolden is in known existence today."

Peterson grew up in the Black neighbourhood of Little Burgundy in Montreal, where he encountered jazz culture. He directed his attention to the piano, with the help of his dad and his sister Daisy, who taught him classical piano.",
        "Peterson was inspired by the blind pianist Art Tatum, who integrated virtuoso keyboard techniques into jazz piano. In his style, Peterson maintained both the traditional rag time, swing piano and boogie-woogie, but also incorporated unpredictable motifs of modern bebop in his improvised solos. Oscar released over 200 recordings and won eight Grammy Awards. Since June 2010, you can find a statue remembering him at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa.",
        "In today's song, the Oscar Peterson Trio are playing 'Ill Wind' by Harold Arlen with lyrics by Ted Koehler. This song was originally written for their last show at the Cotton Club, in 1934, and was sung by Adelaide Hall (this was also the first show to feature nitrogen smoke rising from the floor on stage).",

        "Louis Armstrong was one of the early pioneers of Jazz music, with a career that spanned five decades. Born in New Orleans in 1901, he grew up in poverty, though he worked for and received support from the Karnoffskys, a family of Lithaunian Jews who helped him to buy his first Cornet. At the age of seventeen, Louis began playing trumpet for Kid Ory's band on riverboats in the Mississippi.",
        "In 1922 he moved to Chicago to join his friend King Oliver's band, where he gained a reputation for his extended and creative trumpet solos. Although race relations were poor in the Northern city, good factory jobs meant that Afro-American workers had money left over to spend on entertainment and Armstrong became a full time musician. During this time, Armstrong's second wife, Lil' Harding, encouraged him to broaden his musical repertoire and push for more prominent gigs. In 1924 Armstrong moved to New York for a year to join Fletcher Henderson's orchestra, the top Afro-American band of that era. Afterwards he returned to Chicago where he recorded the iconic Hot Five and Hot Seven sessions.",
        "In the following decade he travelled around the US, developing his singing voice and becoming 'the world's greatest trumpet player'. When Big Band gigs became scarce in the late forties, he formed the very famous 'All Stars' band with many famous ex-band leaders of the era. In 1957 he made national news by criticising President Eisenhower over his inaction during the conflict of school desegregation in Little Rock, Arkansas. In 1964 he recorded his biggest selling record 'Hello, Dolly!', beating out the Beatles and becoming the oldest person to reach number 1 in the Hot 100 chart.  Louis continued to tour for the rest of his life, travelling all over the US, Europe, Africa, Asia and the Soviet Block, earning him the nickname 'Ambassador Satch'."
